Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset

This project involves analyzing Twitter comments related to various airlines to predict whether the sentiments expressed in the tweets are positive, negative, or neutral.
By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project preprocesses the text data, including tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
The sentiment classification is performed using machine learning algorithms that are trained on labeled data, enabling the model to accurately predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.
The outcome provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and brand perception within the airline industry.
